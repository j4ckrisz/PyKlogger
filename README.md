# What is PyKlogger?
PyKlogger is a malware generator that generates unique keyloggers.

## How does it work?
You can choose between two options available right now, the create a simple keylogger option, and the create mail keylogger. Both options generate a unique keylogger every single time, and the code is written with numbers and alphabet letters randomly to obfuscate the code variables and functions once its converted to exe.
